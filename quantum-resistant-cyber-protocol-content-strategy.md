## Frequently Asked Questions

---

### Q: When will quantum computers be able to break current encryption?
**A:** Most experts estimate that cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs) capable of breaking current encryption will emerge within the next 5-10 years. However, the "harvest now, decrypt later" threat means adversaries are already capturing encrypted data today, planning to decrypt it once quantum capabilities become available. Organizations with data requiring long-term confidentiality should begin transition immediately.

---

### Q: What makes post-quantum cryptography different from regular encryption?
**A:** Traditional encryption relies on mathematical problems like factoring large numbers, which quantum computers can solve efficiently using Shor's algorithm. Post-quantum cryptography uses fundamentally different mathematical approaches—such as lattice problems, hash functions, and multivariate equations—that remain computationally infeasible even for quantum computers.

---

### Q: Is post-quantum cryptography slower than current encryption?
**A:** Some post-quantum algorithms have different performance characteristics than traditional encryption. However, NIST-selected algorithms like ML-KEM and ML-DSA are designed for practical deployment with minimal performance impact. Our implementation includes optimization to ensure your operations continue smoothly while security dramatically improves.

---

### Q: Can we wait until quantum computers are closer before acting?
**A:** Waiting is risky for several reasons. First, "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks mean data you encrypt today could be compromised in the future. Second, cryptographic migration typically takes 5-10 years for large organizations. Third, regulatory requirements are already emerging that will mandate quantum-safe encryption. Acting now provides protection and positions you ahead of compliance mandates.

---

### Q: Will post-quantum cryptography protect against all cyber threats?
**A:** Post-quantum cryptography specifically addresses the threat posed by quantum computers to encryption. It does not replace other security measures like firewalls, intrusion detection, access controls, or security awareness training. We recommend a defense-in-depth approach where quantum-resistant encryption is one component of a comprehensive security program.

---

### Q: How does this affect our compliance requirements?
**A:** Regulatory frameworks are rapidly evolving to address quantum threats. NIST has published post-quantum standards (FIPS 203, 204, 205), and we expect CMMC, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and other frameworks to incorporate quantum-safe requirements in the coming years. Implementing quantum-resistant cryptography now positions you ahead of these mandates and demonstrates proactive risk management.

---

### Q: What is crypto-agility and why does it matter?
**A:** Crypto-agility is the ability to quickly switch cryptographic algorithms without complete system redesign. This is important because cryptographic standards evolve, and new vulnerabilities may be discovered. A crypto-agile architecture protects your investment by enabling rapid response to new threats or standards without replacing entire infrastructure.

---

### Q: How long does implementation typically take?
**A:** Implementation timelines vary based on organization size and complexity. A typical enterprise deployment takes 6-12 months from initial assessment to full rollout. We use a phased approach that begins with non-critical systems, allowing us to validate processes before deploying to mission-critical infrastructure. This ensures thorough protection with minimal business disruption.

### Email 2: Threat Deep-Dive (Day 4)
**Subject:** The Attack That's Already Happening

Most organizations think they have years before quantum computers become a threat.

They're wrong.

Sophisticated adversaries—including nation-states and organized cybercriminals—are already capturing encrypted data. They're storing it in massive databases, waiting for the day when quantum computers can break today's encryption.

This is called "harvest now, decrypt later" (HNDL), and it's happening right now.

**What does this mean for you?**

Any data you encrypt today that needs to remain confidential for more than 5-10 years is at risk. This includes:
- Financial records with regulatory retention requirements
- Healthcare data protected under HIPAA
- Intellectual property and trade secrets
- Strategic plans and competitive intelligence
- Personal information and customer data

The encryption you trust today won't survive the quantum era. But quantum-resistant algorithms—standardized by NIST and tested by the global cryptography community—will.

In our next email, we'll explore the NIST post-quantum standards and what they mean for your organization.

Stay quantum-ready,
The QuantumShield Team

### Email 3: Solution Introduction (Day 7)
**Subject:** NIST Has Spoken: Here Are the New Standards

In August 2024, NIST published the first three post-quantum cryptographic standards:

**FIPS 203 (ML-KEM)** - Key encapsulation for secure communication
**FIPS 204 (ML-DSA)** - Digital signatures for authentication
**FIPS 205 (SLH-DSA)** - Hash-based signatures for additional security

These aren't theoretical algorithms—they're production-ready standards that organizations can implement today.

**What makes them quantum-resistant?**

Unlike current encryption based on factoring (which quantum computers can solve efficiently), these algorithms rely on:

- **Lattice-based cryptography** - Mathematical problems involving high-dimensional structures
- **Hash-based cryptography** - One-way functions that quantum computers can't reverse efficiently

These approaches have been studied by cryptographers for decades without finding quantum shortcuts.

**What should you do now?**

1. Conduct a cryptographic inventory to understand your exposure
2. Assess which data requires long-term confidentiality
3. Begin planning your transition to quantum-resistant algorithms
4. Consider crypto-agile architecture for future adaptability

Our next email will walk you through a practical quantum risk assessment framework you can use today.
